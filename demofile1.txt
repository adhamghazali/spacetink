Hayde: I am Hayde, a Dragonborn of Clan Thunderfoot. I was born and raised in the mountains of Skyrim, where my clan has resided for generations. I am a fierce fighter and an unyielding opponent, traits that have served me well in the many battles I have fought both in and out of the arena. My favorite sport is, of course, fighting. There is nothing I enjoy more than testing my skills against worthy opponents.
