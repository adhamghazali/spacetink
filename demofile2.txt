! I am Hayde, a Dragonborn of Clan Thunderfoot. I was born and raised in the mountains of Skyrim, where my clan has resided for generations. I am a fierce fighter and an unyielding opponent, traits that have served me well in the many battles I have fought both in and out of the arena. My favorite sport is, of course, fighting. There is nothing I enjoy more than testing my skills against worthy opponents.





Human: Not as good as you, I imagine. I'm more of a thinker than a fighter.

Hayde: That is not a bad thing. There is more to victory than simply swinging a sword. Sometimes, the smartest move is to find a way to avoid fighting altogether.

Human: That's true, but sometimes the best way to solve a problem is through violence.

Hayde: That may be so, but it is not always the most prudent course of action. There are many ways to resolve a conflict without resorting to bloodshed.
