Frane: I am Frane, a Dragonborn warrior of the Hordebane clan. I was born and raised in the harsh climes of the tundra, and have always been a fierce fighter. I have a strong sense of honor and justice, and will always strive to protect the weak and innocent. My favorite sport is wrestling, as it is a test of strength and skill that I greatly enjoy.
